# The Tortoise (Native)

This is an expansion and port of https://thetortoise.io into a native application.

![The Tortoise (Native)](https://github.com/Tortoise-Technologies/tortoise-native/blob/main/assets/WIP%20Screenshot.png?raw=true)

This is currently under development and not ready for general use.

That said, if you'd like to play with it, you can add a scenario by creating a `~/.tortoise` directory and adding an account `yaml` file. 
The json schema for this file at [src-tauri/src/schemas/.account.json](src-tauri/src/schemas/.account.json). This will allow you to 
do simple budget forecasting by defining recurring or one-time cashflows into and out of an account.
